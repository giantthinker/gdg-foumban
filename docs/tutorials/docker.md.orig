# Development in Docker container

<<<<<<< HEAD
For simpler development setup you can use Docker.

1. Install docker https://docs.docker.com/ (Follow the installation instructions for your platform)
2. Build the image `docker build -t hoverboard .`

Now you have prepared the local development environment!

Now you can run the project with local sources:

    docker run -it -v "$PWD":/app -p 8080:8080 hoverboard

or build the production version:

    docker run -v "$PWD":/app hoverboard polymer build
=======
## For running the website directly from a container you can use docker : 

1. Install docker https://docs.docker.com/ (Follow the installation instructions for your platform)
2. Build the image `docker build -t hoverboard .` and run the website with `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -v "$PWD":/app hoverboard`  

## For specific dev commands, you can run those from container : 

Install all dependencies from docker command line :

    docker run -it -v "$PWD":/app hoverboard npm install
    
Run the site from the container : 

    docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -v "$PWD":/app hoverboard npm run serve

Build the production version:

    docker run -it -v "$PWD":/app hoverboard npm run build
